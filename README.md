# In Pursuit of Interpretable, Fair and Accurate Machine Learning for Criminal Recidivism Prediction

The purpose of the research is to see whether interpretable machine learning models can be helpful in assessing pre-trial risk, in comparison to the Arnold foundation's current methods. Our goal will be to take their pre-trial risk measure (PSA), create our own risk assessment tools using interpretable machine learning methods, and do an empirical comparison.
